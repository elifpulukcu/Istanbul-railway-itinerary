# Istanbul Railway Itinerary

This repository provides a Flask-based web application for planning itineraries across Istanbul‚Äôs railway network, including metro, tram, funicular, and cable car lines. The application displays a Leaflet map of Istanbul and allows users to search for stations, calculate routes, and get detailed step-by-step directions, transfers, and distance information.

## Overview

This project aims to offer a **multi-modal itinerary planner** for the Istanbul railway network. It leverages a JSON dataset of stations and transfer rules to compute routes using an **A\* pathfinding** algorithm. The resulting itinerary displays station-by-station progression, including any necessary line transfers.

However, obtaining up-to-date data from the **[IBB Open Data Portal](https://data.ibb.gov.tr/en/dataset/rayli-sistem-istasyon-noktalari-verisi/resource/3dc8203f-3613-48a8-85e9-24fffb7821ad?view_id%3D32d900ee-7ed4-4ed2-a4a6-be53ab1fc02e)** proved challenging. Many lines, especially newly opened routes (e.g., **M11**), are not yet reflected in older datasets. To address this, I used recently updated GeoJSON files that provide the geospatial locations of many lines and leveraged them to build the lines and transfer points for this planner. Consequently, I created a custom `transfer_rules.json` file to define valid interchange stations. If you need this custom file or have questions about how it was constructed, please reach out.

## Features

1. **Leaflet Map Integration**  
   - Displays a stylized map of Istanbul.
   - Each railway line is color-coded.
   - Stations are rendered as circle markers with interactive popups.

2. **Interactive Station Search**  
   - Type-ahead functionality to filter stations by name.
   - Dropdown suggestions appear dynamically as the user types.

3. **Route Computation**  
   - **A\* Algorithm**: Tailored for railway lines with a geographic distance heuristic (Haversine formula).  
   - **Custom Transfer Costs**: Assigns a higher cost to line transfers, minimizing unnecessary changes.  
   - **Distance & Transfers**: Outputs the total travel distance (in km) and the number of transfers.

4. **Detailed Itinerary**  
   - Textual route breakdown with station-by-station details.  
   - Start and end stations, transfer points, total distance, and transfer count are all included.

5. **API Endpoints**  
   - Supports station searching and route retrieval via JSON responses.

### Notable Files

- **`main.py`**  
  Contains the main Flask application, including:
  - URL routes  
  - A\* route-finding logic  
  - Data loading for stations and transfer rules  

- **`stations.json`**  
  GeoJSON file containing station coordinates, line information, and related metadata.

- **`transfer_rules.json`**  
  Specifies valid line-to-line transfer points, used by the A\* algorithm to compute feasible routes.
